**Insider Threat Detection**

**Team Name:** Quatrix

**Team Member:** Divya Pugalendiran, Hemila Saravanan, Bodhana A, and Lokireddy Madhavi

📌 **Overview**

This project detects insider threats by analyzing three core activity logs. Machine-learning models flag suspicious patterns such as unusual logins, unexpected file access, and abnormal application usage to help prevent internal security breaches.

🚀 **Features**

Three-Source Data Integration: Merges

login.csv – user login/logout events

file_access.csv – file access records

application_usage.csv – application start/end logs

GRU Autoencoder: Unsupervised anomaly detection.

Federated Learning (FedAvg): Simulated privacy-preserving training across nodes.

Random Forest Detector: Final supervised classification and validation.

🏗️ **Tech Stack**

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Matplotlib

Environment: Google Colab 

⚙️ **Methodology**

Preprocessing – Cleaned, normalized, and engineered features from the three datasets.

Modeling –
 1. Federated Learning + Deep Learning combo

      GRU Autoencoder for anomaly detection

      Federated Learning (FedAvg) for distributed privacy

      Random Forest for supervised threat detection

 2. Isolation Forest 
 3. Autoencoder

Evaluation – Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification metrics.

📊 **Results**

High detection accuracy with minimal false positives.

Federated learning performed on par with centralized training while preserving privacy.
